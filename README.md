# Fullstackopen: Complete Exercise 11.20

This repository sets up a simple CI/CD deployment pipeline that includes a CI pipeline that runs on pushes and pull requests to the main branch, a CD pipeline that deploys to Render, and a daily health check to that Render service URL. It also uses semantic versioning and automatic tagging.

It includes:
- tests for frontend
- tests for backend
- end to end tests
- automatic semantic versioning tagging

NOTE: This change was made by a test pull request for exercise 11.21.
